You got this!

Here's the overall process:<br>
1. In your domain registrar, delete your DNS records. Then go to your domain name in your browser and check that it stopped working. **Note:** depending on your domain registrar, it may take from 5 minutes (on Namecheap) to 48 hours for the DNS changes to take effect so you just have to wait. 
2. Create DNS A records to link your domain name to GitHub Pages' IPv4 addresses.<br>
3. Create a CNAME record to link the `www` subdomain to GitHub Pages' domain name (`[your_github_username].github.io`). **Note:** a CNAME record is an easier way to link to GitHub Pages because GitHub Pages has already set up a domain name for us (`[your_github_username].github.io`). Therefore, we don't have to search for their IPv4 addresses. However, CNAME records can only be used when there is a subdomain, which is why we use A records for the base domain name.<br>
4. Create AAAA records to link your domain name to the IPv6 addresses.<br>
5. When you're done, your DNS records should look something like this (except replaced with your own GitHub Pages domain name):

Remember, depending on your domain registrar, it could take from 5 minutes to 48 hours for your DNS records to take effect and for your domain name to start working again.
