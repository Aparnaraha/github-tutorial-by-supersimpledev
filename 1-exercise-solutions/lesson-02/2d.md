You got this!

Here's the overall process:<br>
1. In your domain registrar, delete your DNS records. Then go to your domain name in your browser and check that it stopped working. **Note:** depending on your domain registrar, it may take from 5 minutes (on Namecheap) to 48 hours for the DNS changes to take effect so you just have to wait. 
2. Create A records to link your domain name to GitHub Pages' IPv4 addresses.<br>
3. Create a CNAME record to link the www subdomain to GitHub Pages' domain name (which is `[your_github_username].github.io`).<br>
4. Create AAAA records to link your domain name to the IPv6 addresses.<br>
